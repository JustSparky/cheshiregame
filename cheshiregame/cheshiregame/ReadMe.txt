Simple Visual Studios 2013 Tips:

-All class files are organized under the solution explorer on the right hand panel.
-You can create new files by right clicking the respective folder for it.
-stdafx.h contains ALL the header files needed for the game. If you have a new header file you want to add, be sure to
