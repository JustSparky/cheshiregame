Acquilo was no match for your abilities. He staggers with your final strike, and kneels
in submission. He stares at the ground and with one last breath looks up. Slowly Acquilo
freezes up, converting his now lifeless body into an ice sculpture. You walk up to the
figure and decide to crush it with your weapon. It was a beauty of art, but you clearly
did not see it. You pull the blue gem from the wall and leave the cave.
