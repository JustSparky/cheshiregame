You head back to town and find Astuce near the entrance. He crouches over a patch of flowers
and plucks one off of its stem. "Ah, look at you! You just may be the right one for what I've 
got in store for you." He turns to you and stares at the gem. "So you return safely!
Congratulations!" You hand the jester the gems, and he pockets them into his pouch.

"You've done a good job my friend. You might be wondering what will happen next. Can you guess?"

1. "You'll help restore my memories back?"
2. "You'll invade the mothership?"
3. "You'll sell the gem for gold?"
4. Attack Astuce.
