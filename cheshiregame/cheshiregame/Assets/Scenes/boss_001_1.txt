Elka hisses in terror as you render its strength useless against your attacks. You walk 
up to its eyes and stab into them without mercy. The spider queen is no more. You
take the gem that lies on the podium of the liar, and leave the hatchery. As you
head back to town, a plethora of spiders surround the queen, either mourning for it
or trying to eat its corpse.
