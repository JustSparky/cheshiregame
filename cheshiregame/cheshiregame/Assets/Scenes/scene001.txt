You exit the forest and see an open trail. Since the road is the only lead to what may be 
civilization, you follow the trail all the way to the end. There stood a city that was like 
your typical first-level RPG town. There was a problem though. The town was quiet. Too quiet. 
You walk through the entrance, but there was no one within your view. The town seemed to be 
devoid of life itself. You approach a house and find that its door is open. What do you do?

1.Go inside and loot the house.
2.Yell at the house. There has to be someone in there.
3.Leave the house and head to the town square.
