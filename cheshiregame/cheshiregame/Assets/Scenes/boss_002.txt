At the end dungeon you come across a huge room. A podium stands in the middle of it. Before 
you walk up to grab it, something comes out from the sky! A big scaly figure drops in front of
the podium and glares at you with its red eyes.

Its screech fills the room, causing you to stagger. While you recover, the Rica pounces after you!
