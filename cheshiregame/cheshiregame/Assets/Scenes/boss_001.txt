As you move into the depths of the dungeon, you hear skittering from below. Tons of spiders
start running towards your direction, but they aren't here to attack you. Instead, they
were fleeing...fleeing from what though? As you ponder you feel a large drop of saliva on
your head. Looking up you see a giant spider figure glaring at you with its eight eyes.
Without hesitation, Elka strikes!
