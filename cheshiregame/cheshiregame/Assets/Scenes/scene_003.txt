"I need you to get me three gems. One is green, one is red, and one is blue. They all lie in
different dungeons, all of which are not too far away. However, you must watch out for the 
guardians that lie in each of them."

"Elka, the spider queen, holds the green gem in her hatchery. Rica, the giant monster, guards
the red gem in the Calescent Chamber. And Acquilo, the frostlord, houses the blue gem in the
Frostfang Cavern."

"I suggest you go into the dungeons in the order the guardians I named for you. You can use
the town to purchase items or sleep at the inn to heal yourself. I wish you luck!"
